@AssumptionBuster I’m trying to reproduce a ‘remaining slots feels wrong’ issue using fill → cancel → reserve quickly. List pitfalls, then suggest deeper paths to detect lingering state after transitions.

Logic and assumptions (surface):

The approach assumes rapid fill→cancel→reserve exposes transient inconsistency in remaining slots.
Implicit assumptions include synchronous UI updates, atomic state transitions, and accurate in-memory counters.
Adversarial critique — assumption weaknesses:

UI update timing, event batching, or debounced renders could mask or reorder state changes.
FR-24 and FR-31 expect immediate adjustments, yet SPA in-memory state may produce stale displays.
Persona-based challenge (role perspective):

From a concurrent-user or attacker persona: could race conditions during rapid actions misassociate reservations?
From an admin persona: could manual overrides or edits fail to propagate, leaving inconsistent slots?
Reflective challenge (invite refinement):

Which specific sequence and timing granularity is expected during the reproduce attempt?
Provide assumptions about rendering, event ordering, and admin interactions for deeper critique.
